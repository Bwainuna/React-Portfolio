          <p>
            Hey there! I'm Blake Boiteux, a 25-year-old web development student in Salt Lake City.
            Currently attending Utah Valley University and diving into a full-stack dev bootcamp.
            Beyond coding, I'm into product photography and graphic design. Dreaming of becoming a
            UX/UI designer because I love bringing product stories to life through killer visuals.
            Let's create something awesome! ðŸš€âœ¨
